The Sovereign Access Constant (Csa) v1.0

Status: PATENT PENDING (UK Application No. GB2602979.3) Filing Date: 09 February 2026

Release Authority: Safe Haven Foundation

Executive Summary: The End of the Stored Secret

The Sovereign Access Constant (Csa) is a universal open standard designed to eliminate the "Storage Paradox"—the inherent vulnerability of storing static cryptographic secrets. By replacing passwords, master keys, and biometric templates with ephemeral keys that precipitate only during real-time resonance between user, device, and time, Csa provides the first mathematically immune authentication primitive for the Sovereign Internet.

1. THE LEGAL SHIELD

This technology and its underlying methods for Hardware-Native Identity Precipitation and Zero-Knowledge Authentication are protected under patent law (UK IPO GB2602979.3).

Priority Date: 09 February 2026.

Scope: Covers the entire chain of presence, from the first millisecond of silicon ignition to multi-substrate web-native handshakes.

Integrity Mandate: Any implementation must adhere to the Safe Haven Ethical License (SHEL) v1.0.

2. THE FUNCTIONAL STANDARD

Access is granted by resolving the Sovereign Access Constant:


$$C_{sa} = \oint f(\phi, \omega, \tau)$$

$\phi$ (User Entropy): Volatile behavioral/biological signatures (micro-tremors, linguistic cadence).

$\omega$ (Hardware Resonance): Unique, non-clonable silicon-level device identity.

$\tau$ (Temporal Decay): High-precision expiration ensuring the key exists only in volatile RAM for <100ms.

3. CORE ADVANTAGES

Zero Keys at Rest: There is no "Master Key" to steal and no database to harvest.

Quantum Immunity: Security is derived from information-theoretic truth rather than just computational hardness.

Existence-on-Demand: Your digital identity exists only when you are physically and behaviorally present.

Implementation & Licensing

Developers are invited to explore the open standard and the Hobbyist Demo. Industrial-grade, high-fidelity implementations of the proprietary $f$-function and $r_{ij}$ resonance coefficients require a Sovereign Implementation License.
